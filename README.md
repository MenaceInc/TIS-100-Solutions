# TIS-100 Solutions

These are my solutions for the puzzles in the game [TIS-100](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/).  

I have the repo linked up to my game saves through the use of a junction point. This enables easier tracking of solutions via git.  

These likely won't be the cleanest or fastest solutions but just intended as a bit of fun.

Commit naming style will be the name of the puzzle followed by the resulting cycle count, node count and instruction count. E.g. `SIGNAL AMPLIFIER 160-4-6` is a solution for SIGNAL AMPLIFIER that takes 160 cycles, uses 4 nodes and 6 instructions.
